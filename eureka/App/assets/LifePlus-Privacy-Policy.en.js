    <h4>LifePlus Privacy Policy</h4>
    <p>LifePlus, Inc. (“we,” “our,” “us”) offers the LIFELEAF and GlucoNow continuous health monitoring wearable
      products and LIFELEAF and GlucoNow mobile applications, which are both powered by the LIFELEAF® non-invasive
      continuous vital signs monitoring system. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how LifePlus collects, uses,
      and discloses certain information obtained through the LIFELEAF and GlucoNow wearable products (the “Product”), as
      well as through the LIFELEAF and GlucoNow web and mobile applications (collectively, the “App”). This privacy
      policy also explains how we collect, use, and disclose information collected through our website (“Site”), which
      is located at https://www.lifeplus.ai. In this privacy policy, the Product, App, and Site, are collectively
      referred to as the “Services.” By using our Product or App, visiting our Site and/or by using the Services, you
      are agreeing to the terms of this policy.</p>
    <p>Except as specifically provided below in the sections directed to European Economic Area (“EEA”), this Privacy
      Policy does not apply to any other information collected by LifePlus or through any other means, such as
      information collected offline.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Information we collect and maintain about you</b>
    </p>
    We collect personal and other information including profile images from you directly when you provide it to us
    through the Services. We may also automatically collect certain information about you and your computer, smartphone,
    or other device when you use, access, or interact with the Services.</p>
    <p>
      <b><i>Self-Reported Personal and Health Information.</i></b> When you register for the Services, you will be asked
      to provide personal data, including your name and contact information, as well as demographic information, such as
      your date of birth, gender, ethnic background, skin tone, height and weight. You can also choose to provide
      information about your health, for example, blood type or known diseases, meal descriptions, or symptoms you may
      be experiencing.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can visit the Site without submitting information that we use to identify you personally. However, if you use
      certain features on the Site, such as the “Get in Touch” feature, you will be required to provide personal data.
      Such information could include, for example, your name, email address, and any other information that you choose
      to provide to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><i>Vital Parameters.</i></b> The Product periodically measures and displays your vital parameters, for example,
      your blood glucose levels, heart rate, respiration rate, blood oxygen saturation and blood pressure, at recurring
      intervals or on demand. The Product can also track the number of steps that you take each day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><i>Information from your medical provider.</i></b> If you were referred to our Services through your medical
      provider, with your authorization, we may receive information relating to your medical history and treatment plan
      from your medical provider.
    </p>
    <p><b><i>Contacts.</i></b> You can also choose to share information about your vital parameters with your doctor or
      your relations and friends. If you choose to share this information, we will ask for the individuals’ name and
      contact information, as well as their relation to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><i>Web log data.</i></b> When you use the Services, we automatically receive and record certain information

      applications that recognize your computer and gather information about its online activity.

    <p>
      <b><i>Cookies.</i></b> With your consent, we also use cookies on the Site. Cookies are small files that are stored
      on your computer by your web browser. A cookie allows the Site to recognize whether you have visited before and

      you download), your computer’s operating system and browser type, your Internet service provider, your domain name
      and IP address, your general geographic location, the website that you visited before the Site, and the link you

      <b><i>Third-party online tracking.</i></b> We also may partner with certain third parties to collect, analyze, and
      use some of the personal and other information described in this section. For example, we may allow third parties
      to set cookies or use web beacons on the Site or in email communications from us. This information may be used for
      a variety of purposes, including online web analytics, as discussed below (see the section entitled “With whom we
      share your information”).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>How we use your information</b>

    <p>
      <b><i>To provide our Services.</i></b> We use the information you provide to us in order to provide you with our
      Services when you register for and use our App and wearable product. These Services include providing you and your
      medical provider with your vitals as well graphs and reports that display your vitals over time so that you and
      your medical provider can see averages and identify other trends.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><i>To draw inferences.</i></b> Based on the information you provide to us and information we collect regarding
      your interaction with our Services, we may infer insights about your overall health and medical conditions. With

    <p>
      <b><i>To improve our algorithms and machine learning processes.</i></b> We may use the calibration information you
      provide, as well as information relating to your use of and interaction with our Services, to improve our
      Services, specifically the algorithms and machine learning processes that we use to analyze your health
      information. The results of these improvements will both improve our services and may be used to provide you and

    <p>
      <b><i>Clinical research.</i></b> We may use the information you provide to conduct internal clinical research or

      partners) will be conducted pursuant to review by an Institutional Review Board where appropriate, and your
      information either will be provided to the clinical researcher with your consent (as defined by the Institutional
      Review Board) or be de identified throughout the research.

    </p>
    LifePlus provides users with control over their personal data such as the following:
    <ul>

        longer be able to use the Product.</li>
      <li>If you opt to erase your personal data and forgo the measurement of future vitals by terminating your account,
        you can optionally download the 'MyArchivedData' report for your future reference. The option of generating this
        report will be given at the time when you decide to erase your personal data and terminate the account.</li>

    <p>
      You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we
      may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive. Alternatively, we may
      refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to
      access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that
      personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you
      for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
    </p>
    <p>
      We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than one month
      if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you
      and keep you updated.
    </p>
    <p><b>External Links</b></p>
    <p>
      This Site and App may contain links to third-party websites. If you use these links, you will leave the Site or
      App. We have not reviewed these third-party sites and do not control and are not responsible for any of these
      sites, their content, or their privacy policy. Thus, we do not endorse or make any representations about them, or
      any information, software, or other products or materials found there, or any results that may be obtained from
      using them. If you decide to access any of the third-party sites listed on our website, you do so at your own
      risk.
    </p>
    <p><b>Data Security</b></p>
    <p>
      We employ physical, technical, and administrative procedures to safeguard the personal data we collect. However,
      no website or mobile app is 100% secure, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you
      transmit to the Services or to us, and you transmit such information at your own risk.
    </p>
    <p><b>Data Retention</b></p>
    <p>
      We retain personal data about you as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which that information was collected or
      as required or permitted by law. We do not retain personal data longer than is necessary for us to achieve the
      purposes for which we collected it. When we destroy your personal data, we do so in a way that prevents that
      information from being restored or reconstructed.
    </p>
    <p><b>International Users</b></p>
    <p>
      The information that we collect through or in connection with the Site is transferred to and processed in the
      United States for the purposes described above. We also may subcontract the processing of your data to, or
      otherwise share your data with, affiliates or third parties in the United States or countries other than your
      country of residence. The data-protection laws in these countries may be different from, and less stringent than,
      those in your country of residence. By using the Site or by providing any personal or other information to us, you
      expressly consent to such transfer and processing.

      We may make changes to the Services in the future and as a consequence will need to revise this Policy to reflect
      those changes. We will post all such changes on the Services, so you should review this page periodically. If we
      make a material change to the Policy, you will be provided with appropriate notice.
    </p>
