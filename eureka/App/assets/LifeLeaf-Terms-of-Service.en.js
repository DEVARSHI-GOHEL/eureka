            <p>LifePlus, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, “<span style="text-decoration:underline">LifePlus</span>”) provides: (a) a LIFELEAF user account website that may be accessed at https://webportal.lifeplus.ai/ (the “<span style="text-decoration:underline">Site</span>”), (b) a LIFELEAF mobile application (“<span style="text-decoration:underline">App</span>”); and
                (c) services, including subscription services that can be accessed using, and receive data from, LifePlus’s smartwatch product (“<span style="text-decoration:underline">Product</span>”) and otherwise through the Site and App (“<span style="text-decoration:underline">SaaS Services</span>”), all for use in conjunction with Products
                and in other ways that LifePlus provides. The term “Services” means the Site, App and the SaaS Services. The term “Embedded Software” means any embedded software on the Product, including any firmware.
                <p>These Terms of Service (“<span style="text-decoration:underline">Terms</span>”) govern your access to and use of the Services and Embedded Software. Please read these terms carefully. They require the use of binding arbitration to resolve disputes rather than jury trials or class actions.
                    Please follow the instructions in the Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Section below if you wish to opt out of this provision. The term “you,” as used in these Terms, means any person or entity who accesses or uses the Services and
                    any person or entity who creates an Account (as defined in Section 2(a)) and accepts these Terms. These Terms give you specific legal rights, and you may also have other legal rights in addition, which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
                    The disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations of liability under these Terms will not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or the exclusion org limitation
                    of incidental or consequential damages or other rights, so those provisions of these Terms may not apply to you</p>
                <p class="highlight-detail" style="font-weight: 600;">Additionally, these Terms provided in Section 5 that certain terms and conditions apply with respect to recurring subscription charges for certain paid account types.</p>

                    THE ACCESS. YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT, AUTHORITY, AND CAPACITY TO ACCEPT AND AGREE TO THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF YOURSELF OR THE ENTITY YOU REPRESENT. YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE OF SUFFICIENT LEGAL AGE IN YOUR
                    JURISDICTION OR RESIDENCE TO USE OR ACCESS THE SERVICES AND TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY OF THE PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS, YOU SHOULD DISCONNECT YOUR PRODUCTS FROM YOUR ACCOUNT (AS DESCRIBED BELOW) AND

                <p>AS DESCRIBED BELOW, YOU ARE CONSENTING TO AUTOMATIC SOFTWARE UPDATE OF THE SERVICES AND OF THE PRODUCTS CONNECTED TO THE SERVICES (INCLUDING THE EMBEDDED SOFTWARE). IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, YOU SHOULD NOT USE THE SERVICES.</p>

                <p>(a) Overview and Relation to Other Agreements. These Terms govern your use of the Services and the Embedded Software. Your purchase of any Product is governed by the limited warranty provided with that Product, the warranty available at
                    https://www.lifeplus.ai/Warranty (“Limited Warranty”) and these Terms. Certain features of the Services may be subject to additional guidelines, terms, or rules, which will be posted on the Services in connection with such features.
                    All additional guidelines, terms, or rules, and the LIFELEAF Privacy Policy ("<span style="text-decoration:underline">Privacy Policy</span>") available at https://www.lifeplus.ai/PrivacyPolicy , are incorporated by reference into these Terms and you are agreeing to accept and abide
                    by them by using the Services and the Embedded Software.
                </p>
                <p>(b) Eligibility. You may use the Services and the Embedded Software only if you are age 18 and older and can form a binding contract with LifePlus, and only if you are in compliance with these Terms and all applicable local, state/provincial,
                    national, and international laws, rules, and regulations. Only individuals aged 18 and older are permitted to act as owners of LifePlus Accounts. Any use or access to the Services or Embedded Software by individuals under the age of
                    18 is strictly prohibited and is a violation of these Terms. The Services and Embedded Software are not available to any users previously prohibited from using the Services or Embedded Software by LifePlus.</p>
                <p>(c) Customer Service. If you have any questions or concerns regarding the Products, the Services, the Embedded Software or these Terms, please contact LifePlus. </p>
                <p>(d) Term and Termination. These Terms will remain in full force and effect so long as you continue to access or use the Services and/or Embedded Software, or until terminated in accordance with the provisions of these Terms. At any time,
                    LifePlus may (i) suspend or terminate your rights to access or use the Services and/or Embedded Software, or (ii) terminate these Terms with respect to you if LifePlus in good faith believes that you have used the Services in violation
                    of these Terms, including any incorporated guidelines, terms or rules. If you transfer a Product to a new owner, your right to use the Services and Embedded Software with respect to that Product automatically terminates, and the new
                    owner will have no right to use the Product, Services and/or Embedded Software under your Account (as described below) and will need to register for a separate Account with LifePlus. Note that deleting the App from your device will
                    not terminate your Account, but you may terminate your Account and these Terms as set forth in Section 5 below.</p>
                <p>(e) Effect of Termination. Upon termination of these Terms, your Account and your right to use the Services will automatically terminate.</p>

To use the Services, you must register for a user account (“<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Account</span>”) and provide certain information about yourself as prompted by the applicable registration form. You represent and warrant that: (a) all required registration
                    information you submit is truthful and accurate; (b) you will maintain the accuracy of such information; and (c) your use of the Services does not violate any U.S. or other applicable law or regulation (e.g., you are not located in
                    an embargoed country or are not listed as a prohibited or restricted party under applicable export control laws and regulations). You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account login information and
                    for all activities that occur under your Account. You agree to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper- and lower-case letters, numbers and symbols) with your Account, and to maintain your password securely
                    to prevent others from gaining access without your permission. You agree to immediately notify LifePlus of any unauthorized use, or suspected unauthorized use, of your Account or any other breach of security. LifePlus is not liable
                    for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above requirements. You are responsible for the actions and omissions of anyone using your Products and the Services with your Account Credentials.</p>

                    the Product (including the Embedded Software). If you do not terminate a previously created Account, you will receive Updates automatically. You acknowledge that you may be required to install Updates to use the Services and the Product

                    Software to make it interoperable without LifePlus’s consent, before you exercise any such rights, you shall notify LifePlus of such desire and, no later than sixty (60) days following receipt of such request, LifePlus may decide either
                    to: (a) perform the work to achieve such interoperability and charge its then- standard rates for such work to you; or (b) permit you to reverse engineer parts of such Embedded Software only to the extent necessary to achieve such

                <p>Nothing in these Terms and in particular within this "Limitation of Liability" clause shall attempt to exclude liability that cannot be excluded under applicable law.<br/><br/> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN ADDITION

                    <p>13.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Dispute Resolution and Arbitration </span></p>
                    <p>(a) Agreement to Arbitrate. This Section 13 is referred to herein as the “Arbitration Agreement.”
                      The parties that any and all controversies, claims, or disputes between you and LifePlus arising
                      out of, relating to, or resulting from these Terms, shall be subject to binding arbitration pursuant
                      to the terms and conditions of this Arbitration Agreement, and not any court action (other than a
                      small claims court action to the extent the claim qualifies). The Federal Arbitration Act governs
                      the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.<br/><br/>
                      (b) Class Action Waiver. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS
                      AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF
                      OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR
                      PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH PARTIES AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY
                      NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AND
                      MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED,
                      REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD
                      RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY
                      IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT
                      NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL
                      CLAIM(S).<br/><br/>
                      (c) Procedures. Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the
                      American Arbitration Association’s (“<span style="text-decoration: underline;">AAA</span>”) rules and procedures (the “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">AAA Rules</span>”), as
                      modified by this Arbitration Agreement. If there is any inconsistency between the AAA Rules and
                      this Arbitration Agreement, the terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the
                      arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would
                      not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of this
                      Agreement as a court would, including without limitation, the limitation of liability provisions in
                      Section 12. You may visit http://www.adr.org for information on the AAA and
                      http://www.adr.org/fileacase for information on how to file a claim against LifePlus.<br/><br/>
                      (d) Venue. The arbitration shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually
                      agreed location. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or LifePlus may elect to
                      have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election
                      shall be binding on each party, but subject to the arbitrator’s discretion to require an in-person
                      hearing if the circumstances warrant. Attendance at any in-person hearing may be made by
                      telephone by either or both parties unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.<br/><br/>
                      (e) Governing Law. The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the
                      laws of the state of California, without regard to its conflicts of laws rules, and will honor all claims
                      of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations
                      involving different Services or Product users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving
                      you to the extent required by applicable law.<br/><br/>(f) Costs of Arbitration. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the
                      “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Arbitration Fees</span>“) will be governed by the AAA’s Rules. Each party will be responsible for all
                      other fees it incurs in connection with the arbitration, including without limitation, all attorney
                      fees.<br/><br/>
                      (g) Confidentiality. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision or award by
                      the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.<br/><br/>
                      (h) Severability. If a court decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement other
                      than Section 13(b) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision
                      with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the
                      intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall
                      be enforceable as so modified. If a court decides that any of the provisions of Section 13(b) is
                      invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void.
                      The remainder of these Terms will continue to apply.</p>

                        through support@lifeplus.ai. You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the

                        (c) Counter-Notice. If you believe that your Content that was removed (or to which access was
                        disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the
                        copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use the material in your Content, you
                        may send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Copyright Agent: (i) Your
                        physical or electronic signature; (ii) Identification of the Content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the Content appeared before it was removed or
                        disabled; (iii) A statement that you have a good faith belief that the Content was removed or
                        disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the Content; and (iv) Your name, address,
                        telephone number, and e-mail address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal
                        court in San Francisco, California, and a statement that you will accept service of process from the
                        person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.
                        <br/><br/>
                        (d) If a counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, LifePlus may send a copy of the counter-
                        notice to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed
                        
                        Content or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action
                        seeking a court order against the Content provider, member or user, the removed Content may be
                        
                        replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter- notice, at LifePlus's sole discretion.</p>

                        <p>(a) Changes to these Terms. LifePlus reserves the right to make changes to these Terms. We'll post
                          notice of modifications to these Terms on this page. You should ensure that you have read and
                          agree with our most recent Terms when you use the Services or Products. Continued use of the
                          Services or Products following notice of such changes shall indicate your acknowledgment of such
                          changes and agreement to be bound by the revised Terms.<br/><br/>
                          (b) Governing Law. The courts in some countries will not apply California law to some types of
                          disputes. If you reside in one of those countries, then where California law is excluded from
                          applying, your country's laws will apply to such disputes related to these terms. Otherwise, you
                          agree that these Terms, and any claim, dispute, action, cause of action, issue, or request for relief
                          arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the Products and Services shall be governed
                          by the laws of the State of California without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that
                          may provide the application of the law of another jurisdiction. You agree to submit to the personal
                          jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in or for Santa Clara County, California for the purpose
                          of litigating all such claims or disputes, unless such claim or dispute is required to be arbitrated as
                          set forth in an above Section.<br/><br/>
                          (c) Protection of Confidentiality and Intellectual Property Rights. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
                          LifePlus may seek injunctive or other equitable relief to protect its confidential information and
                          intellectual property rights or to prevent loss of data or damage to its servers in any court of
                          competent jurisdiction.<br/><br/>
                          (d) Entire Agreement/Severability. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and
                          LifePlus regarding the use of the Services. Any failure by LifePlus to exercise or enforce any right
                          or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The Section
                          titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. If any
                          provision of these Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other
                          provisions of these Terms will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be
                          deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. Neither party is an agent or partner of the other party. (e) Survivability. The obligations in Sections 3(d), 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 15 will survive
                          any expiration or termination of these Terms.<br/><br/>
                          (f) Assignment. These Terms, and any associated rights or obligations, may not be assigned or
                          otherwise transferred by you without LifePlus’s prior written consent. These Terms may be
                          assigned by LifePlus without restriction. These Terms are binding upon any permitted assignee.<br/><br/>
                          (g) Notifications. LifePlus may provide notifications to you as required by law or for marketing or
                          other purposes via (at its option) email to the primary email associated with your Account, mobile
